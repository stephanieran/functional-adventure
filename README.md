# functionalAdventure
I built a text-based adventure game (roughly in the style of Colossal Adventure or Zork) in Haskell. The game is set in a gym, and the goal is to traverse the map looking for specific items, ultimately bringing the exercise mat to the strength training room to win. The game has power-ups like drinking gatorade to boost strength and a challenge feature like slippery items that slip out of the player's inventory.
