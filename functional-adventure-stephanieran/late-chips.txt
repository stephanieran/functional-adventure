I would like to use a 24hr late chip!
Today is April 14th, 2023, I'll make
sure to have it done by April 15th @5pm.
Thanks!


I'm using my second one too! I'm at Nationals for a club volleyball
tournament, and we made it much further than expected. We ended up
getting second place in our gold bracket! Hence I'm using my second
late chip today!
